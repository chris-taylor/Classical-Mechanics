-- |This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 10-point, 21-point, 43-point and
--87-point integration rules in succession until an estimate of the integral
--of @f@ over @(a,b)@ is achieved within the desired error limit.
intQNG :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Double -> Double
intQNG f a b = fst $ GSL.integrateQNG 1e-6 f a b

-- |This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 21-point integration rule
--adaptively until an estimate of the integral of @f@ over @(a,b)@ is achieved
--within the desired error limits. The results are extrapolated using the
--epsilon-algorithm, which accelerates the convergence of the integral in the
--presence of discontinuities and integrable singularities.

--using 100 intermediate points.
